Word Pair Problem

The Basics

Given a list of words, find a pair with the highest score.
The score is determined by multiplying the lengths of the words by one another.
For instance:
[Spoke, Branch] = 30
   5   *   6    = 30

With the exception that if the words share any letters in common then the pair's score is zero.
For instance, the following pair yields a score of 0 because both words contain the letter 'r' :
[Shrink, Branch] = 0

Some Details

Your method should return a single pair of words.
In the event that multiple pairs tie for the highest score...
    Any of these pairs is an acceptable answer
    Pick one and only one, don't return a list of pairs
Zero, while the lowest possible score, is a valid score
